# MLOps_Zoomcamp_Study
This is the repository of my study in MLOps Zoomcamp from DataTalksClub. <br><br>
MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices and tools designed to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. It combines machine learning (ML) with DevOps (Development Operations) to automate and streamline the process of developing, testing, and deploying ML models. <br><br> Key Aspects of MLOps 
- Automation
- Collaboration
- Monitoring
- Versioning
- Scability
